![Louisville, KY Urban Development from 2001 to 2019](Louisville_Image.jpg)

Louisville is a constantly expanding city with a population of 624,444 as on 2022. This expansion process has taken a bite out of the tree canopy of the forested land in and around the city. This map uses NLCD land cover data from KyFromAbove through kyrastre.ky.gov to show this change from decidous forest and mixed forest to low intensity development and high intensity development between the years 2001 to 2019.
